<H1>British Light Teamware</H1>
<BR>by Jeff Davies<BR>
A simple system with the raw functionality of Lotus Notes.
A very early alpha and GNU Public licenced.
<BR>Version 0.01 "Balti"
<BR><BR>
To install, extract to a directory, then create a file in /etc called
blt.conf containing the path of the "data" directory of blt.<BR>eg:
  /root/projects/blt/data<BR><BR>
<A href="blt.tar">Get the Tarball of the tcl/tk files here</A>
<P>Hoorah 1.10 (12/9/00) now has relication and scrolling on the database list
(main dialog). Need to apply Close, Refresh and Scrolling to all other
dialogs using lists (and Close to all dialogs).
</P><P></P><P>Replication - blt uses linux "cp -u" (update replication). The idea is
that the data is stored in a zip file on a website (to preserve creation dates).
The "replicator" shell script should call a ftp script to pull down the zip,
then unzip it to a "remote data" location on the filestore,
 replicate with the local data using "cp -u", then rezip remote data, and upload
it back to the ftp server.</P>
<P></P> Note in this simplistic approach there is no way to keep the discarded
side of a replication conflict other than to use a filesystem (journaling?)
which keep old copies of files. Also, if two clients replicate with the
ftp server at the same time, problems could ensue. A simple locking file
used by shell script (through ftp script) could probably prevent this).
