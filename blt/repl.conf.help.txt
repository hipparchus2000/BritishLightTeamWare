repl.conf.help.text
===================

The /etc/blt.repl.conf file contains instructions to the replicator in the format as described below:
NOTE: all replicas are assumed to be on the same file system, since it is easy in Linux/Unix to
mount foreign file systems onto the local file system. Other options for example, might be
to download files to an area by ftp, and synchronise them by the replicator, then upload them again
by ftp, which would be fine for smaller quantities of data.

FORMAT:

remote-replica-location:databaseID

eg:

/usr/ftp/stuff:20000728-174500-johnsmith-sunserver1
/usr/ftp/stuff:20000431-221100-jimblakey-solaris2
