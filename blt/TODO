BLT is Light Teamware.

I originally called this project TCO and the BIT. I can't remember what
those stood for, however, later I mistook BIT for BLT which is an
acronym for Bacon Lettuce and Tomato (sandwiches) which are rather nice.

The same code can be implemented fairly easily in Java, C++ VB
or whatever takes your fancy.

WHAT IS BLT.

The initial objective is to produce something really simple that is similar
to Lotus Notes in it's capabilities.
Initially, the Form Design is very simple, just a list of fields.
NOTE you can't have a blank field in between two other fields, and capital
letters are not allowed in field names (or spaces and -*/=\) etc ).

Tasks Outstanding

1. Make Views powerful (sort and using a form selection formula).
perhaps a saved view index later. 
2. Make a replicator (this requires adding last modified dates to documents
NOTE replication will take place via the file system, so to replicate with
a database on the other side of the world, create a NFS share on one
machine, mount it on the other, then replicate.
3. Add security. This can be based on Unix filesystem security.
4. Add encryption (PGP ?).
5. Attached files to document of filepath
 /blt-data-dir-path/db-id.dir/documents/docid will be simpy put
in the directory /blt-data-dir-path/db-id.dir/documents/docid.dir 
6. An early task will be XML format output of the data, however long term
the data including all form design etc might all be stored in XML
using (for implementation in TCL) a TCL XML parser.
7. Delete buttons (eg: delete database, form etc with 'are you sure'
 prompt boxes).
